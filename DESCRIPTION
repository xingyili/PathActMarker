Description: PathActMarker integrates widely used normalization methods as well as seven state-of-the-art pathway activity inference methods into an effective framework for inferring pathway activity. PathActMarker can rank the importance of pathways and identify the top-ranked pathways as biomarkers for visualization and interpretation. Finally, the performance of pathway activity inference methods can be compared by ARI scores and visualized by violin plot.
